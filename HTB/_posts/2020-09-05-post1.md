# Brief Summary
Hello, this is my first writeup and it's going to be about HackTheBox: Mango machine. The box is retired now which means we can talk about it publicly. I personally enjoyed playing mango machine, I learned new stuff and had fun.

# Nmap
Starting off, with **nmap** to get an idea about the machine and the services running. `nmap 10.10.10.162 -A` will provide us with os detection, versions of serviecs running if applicable and traceroute of the target.

```nmap
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-05-27 20:40 +03
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.162
Host is up (0.096s latency).

from the output of nmap, we can note that there is a web application running on port 80/443 and has a certificate with a domain name registered as **staging-order.mango.htb**


# Enumeration
when i visited port **80** i got Forbidden response from server. So i visited port **443** instead. but the page didnt load completely, the broweser notified me for connection not secured, which is weird. So i looked to into the certificate and found this domain **staging-order.mango.htb** mango that got caught previously with nmap. i accepted the risk and continued. The page loaded completely:

the search engine doesn't work yet. and 'Analytics' was a rabit hole believe me. i spent hours and got put with nothing. lets start burp suite, and intrecpt the traffic. First thing i will do, is to add the hostname resolution rule in burp -> project options -> connections.

this time i visited the new domain, and found a login page. intresting...

lots of mangos appearently. the machine name and these pictures. Lets fuzz the login page little bit with different sql injection techniques. We should also include NoSql. Since you know, MongoDB is one of popular Databases and the box name is some how rhyme with it.

# NoSql Injection & More Enumeratation
lets capture the login request with **Burp Suite**, and send it to repteater.

After trying many things, and looking online for useful articles about slqi on MongoDB. 
[Found this article](https://nullsweep.com/a-nosql-injection-primer-with-mongo).

And The way to inject the parameters will be like

original POST data: 
```json
username=admin&password=&login=login
```

injected with NoSql attack: 
```json
username [$ne]=admin&password [$ne]=&login=login
```

By using `[$ne]` we specify that stored data in the DB should not be equal to our input.
here we have a redirection.

following that a successful login.
